There is no additive or preservative added and they really bring out the flavors & aroma in the food.When I was a kid, my mom would tell me that readymade coriander powder is adulterated with horse-dung. And this was so many years agoâ€¦ Just imagine now what it would be. As a result my mother would make all the Indian spice powders at home from scratch."
